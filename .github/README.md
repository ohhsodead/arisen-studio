## Introduction

The elegant, powerful, and open-source mod manager. Arisen Studio allows you to easily browse through a regularly updated database of mods, game saves, homebrew, resources, themes, and much more for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. All mods have been tested and verified in our library, which is populated by me, some friends, and awesome contributors. Arisen Studio can also be used as an FTP client to automatically install and uninstall mods directly from your computer. Without the need to search up old posts or use file managers - this will do everything for you.

**the only one of its kind...**

## Bug Reports

Arisen Studio isn't perfect. If you encounter any issues, you are encouraged to submit bug reports through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ohhsodead/arisen-studio/issues/new?&labels=bug&template=bug.yml&title=%5BBug+Report%5D%3A+). Please make your reports as detailed as possible. Be sure to include any exception messages you get (if any), and give steps showing how we can reproduce the behavior you encountered.

## Contributing

You're also welcome to submit any pull requests with fixes and suggestions, like additional features for making this project even more great. Please open an issue so we can discuss things before going further, maybe we can work on this together!

### Database

Arisen Studio previously used a self-curated repository for its database, but we have since migrated to a more secure server to enhance performance. The old repository is no longer in use and can be considered obsolete.

If you want to contribute or request mods to the database, you can submit a request via [this form](https://arisen.studio/submit) on our website or [open an issue](https://github.com/ohhsodead/arisen-studio-database/issues/new?assignees=&labels=mod+request&projects=&template=mod_request.yml&title=%5BRequest%5D%3A+).

### Translations
For the localization process we use the collaborative platform from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/), thanks to their generosity for providing a professional service to Open Source projects free of charge. Please read the [introduction for new translators](https://support.crowdin.com/crowdin-intro/) and [guide for using the online editor](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/) to understand how it works.

If you are already familiar with the Crowdin platform and want to contribute your time to translating a few strings, just head to our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/arisenstudio) to get started.

## Requesting Mods

I know that not all mods aren't on our database, but if you [submit this form](https://arisen.studio/submit) with the details then we can get them added for you!
